// CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS

If Else:

x = 10
if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
elif x == 10:
    print("x is equal to 10")
else:
    print("x is less than 10")

x = 10
message = "x is greater than 5" if x > 5 else "x is 5 or less" // One liner or ternary conditional where else is a must
print(message)

Match Case:

weekdays = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"]
match day:
    case d if d in weekdays:  // can use array search
        return "Weekday" // no need for break
    case "Saturday" | "Sunday": // can use if else as well
        return "Weekend"
    case _:
        return "Not a valid day"

// LOOPS

For Loop:

fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

While Loop:

i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1

Break:

for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)

Continue:

for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        continue
    print(i)

For else:

for i in range(5):
    print(i)
else:
    print("Loop completed!")

While else:

i = 0
while i < 3:
    print(i)
    i += 1
else:
    print("Finished looping")

Nested loops:

for i in range(3):
    for j in range(2):
        print(f'i = {i}, j = {j}')
